           <p>Known as the early 20th century Fauvist artist an rival to the Cubist painter Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse was born in Le Cateau-Cambre, France on December 31, 1869. In 1887, Matisse went to study law and worked as a court administrator in Le Cateau-Cambresis. He started painting when he was bedridden from apprendicitis. His mother nurtured his talent by buying him art supplies. He decided to choose art over studying law, disappointing his father. Matisse studied art at the Acadamie Julian and studied under the artists William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Gustave Moreau in Paris, France in 1891.</p>

           <p>In 1896, Matisse was introduced to Impressionism and van Gogh's work which influenced his own style. Matisse had his first solo exhibition in 1904. It was not successful. During this period (1896-1906), he was not well-known. In 1905, he exhibit a new art style called Fauvism with a group of other artists. Fauvism art style is defined by flat shapes, strong use of primary colors and defined lines. In this exhibition, this style of art was highly criticised by critics and patrons a like. His most controversial painting is "The Woman with a hat". It became a short-live art genre.</p>

            <p>Matisse was good friends with Picasso, who was also his rival. His artistic prime was between 1906 and 1917. He continued to pull influence from Moorish aesthetics. Through out his art career, Matisse engaged with other artists. On the right is the painting "Bathers by a River". It is partially inspired by Cubism, an art style that is associated with Picasso. </p>

           <p>During World War II and the later years of his life, Matisse continued to work as an artist despite his declining health. He worked as an illustrator and graphic designer. Although he remained isolated, and his art career spared by the Nazi occupation of France, his family was involved in the French Resistance. His son Pierre helped artists (Jewish and Resistance allied artists)escape Vichy France and his daughter Maugueritte was a part of the resistance, caught by Gestapo and tortured almost to death. She escaped the train sending her to a concentration camp.</p>

           <p>Suffering from cancer, Matisse could not paint anymore, because the physical labor of painting and sculpting was too taxing on his physical health. He relied on canvas and paper art as a new medium to explore.Jazz series was created toward the end of his life and reflect a style similar to his typical work, except more abstract in shapes and use of color. Matisse died on November 3, 1954 of a heart attack. His remains are interred in the Monastere Notre Dame de Cimiez in Nice, France.</p>

                <p>Although his work is positioned as the <a href="sorrow-of-the-king.jpg" target="_blank">opposite</a> of Picasso, Matisse was an extraordinary artist in his own right.His art style changed the world of art. He was a post-impressionist and one of the first artists in modern art history to primarily use color and abstract shapes in representational art. One of his most controversial paintings is "Woman with a hat"(1905). It uses primary color to suggest shade and contrast, as oppose to realistic flesh-tones typically found in portraiture.</p> 


                <p>Matisse created a genre of art called Fauvism, which changed the way art is created and viewed. Fauvism has arguably influenced the style and techniques of modern art by challenging the attitudes of what is considered to be "good" art. According to <a href="https://www.theartstory.org/artist/matisse-henri/" target="_blank">The Art Story</a>, Matisse's art " was important in endorsing the value of decoration in modern art". Matisse's art style is commonly associated with energy and happiness. Very rarely is his subject associated with darkness and seriousness that plagued the early 20th century. </p> 

                <p>Matisse's art work toward the end of his life influence other modern and contemporary artists. The contemporary conceptual artist Kara Walker is influenced by Matisse's collage art. Jazz series influence the newest illustration style and graphic design found in online publications covers of magazines. (see video on corporate art <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFb7BOI_QFc&ab_channel=SolarSands" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
                <p>According to writer Rachel Hawley of AIGA in the <a href="https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/dont-worry-these-gangley-armed-cartoons-are-here-to-protect-you-from-big-tech/" target="_blank">article</a> "Don't Worry, These Gangly-Armed Cartoons are Here to Proect You From Big Tech", the design style called Alegria (spanish for joy) features "a typical illustration of smiling figures, drawn in a flat minimal style wth skin in a bright, pastel blue, pink or green, and gangly, disproportionately large arms and legs"(2019) Alegria shares some of the characteristics of Matisse's art in his Jazz collage series. Although the differences between Matisse's art and Alegria illustration are noticeable, it is obvious that Matisse's colorful cut-outs at least partially inspired the corporate illustration and graphic design style that is currently popular on the web and among tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Airbnb and Hinge among others.</p>
